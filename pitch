# ProjectFuturisticSurvival

> Imagined after seeing Star Wars episode 7 and episode 4, inspired by Dune and Red Mars.

Desertic planet in the future where people can barely survive.

A planet formerly colonised by the future European Union thanks to near future technologies.
It took two centuries to reach this planet and colonise it.

A new technology appeared and allow spaceships to "jump" from Earth to this planet in a matter of months instead of centuries.
But this technology requires a beacon to be in orbit of this planet.

But a disaster destroyed this beacon and it now takes again centuries to reach this planet.
As a consequence, the European Union let this colony alone and its colonists to their fate.

It is now centuries later and no contact have been made to this planet from the outer space.
The existence of Earth and the EU became legendary or even forgotten.

The player has to control a character in this planet and make him survive through its harsh environment.

But something unexpected will happen: a spaceship will appear in orbit.
It will be the first contact for this planet in centuries.
Everything will be different now.
